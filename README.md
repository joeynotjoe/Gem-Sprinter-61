# GEM Sprinter 61
> A repository to collect information and schematics for the Gem Sprinter 61 organ.

PDF Schematics are often hard to track down, and when you find them, they can be held for ransom at high prices. These instruments are already difficult to work on, so I am adding this here in case anyone else needs it.

### If you have other GEM organ-related schematics, let's expand this repository.
